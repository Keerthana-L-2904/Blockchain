✨ Brief Idea
This is a custom blockchain implementation project aimed at understanding blockchains. 
It has a native cryptocurrency with miners and the transactions are stored in Merkle Tree.
The blockchain is Proof of Work based on simulated miner block sealing and block reward system.

🧩 Components
Block: Stores hash, Merkle root, transactions, and nonce
Blockchain: List-like structure maintaining the block sequence
MerkleTree: Generates Merkle root from hashed transactions
Miner Selection: Picks the miner with highest BSS = competence_score * BHS
Nonce Finder: Computes a nonce such that the hash ends in '0' (simulates PoW)

🔍 How it Works
Create Accounts with user-defined balances
Input Transactions and filter based on balances and incentives
Group Valid Transactions (up to 4 per block)
Build Merkle Tree and get Merkle Root
Generate Block Hash using previous block’s hash + Merkle root
Find Nonce such that the final hash ends in '0'
Select Miner using BSS and reward with block incentive
Append Block to blockchain and print details
